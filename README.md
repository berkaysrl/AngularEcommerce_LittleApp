## Ecommerce
This project was made by berkaysrl using AngularCli 16.1.4 and Bootstrap.

## What I did
I crafted a service to meticulously interpret the data harvested from the Onlinetestapi site. Subsequently, I transferred this data to the Homepage, fostering an interactive environment that allows users to effortlessly add their desired products to their shopping carts from the comfort of the homepage.

## Purposes
Using Observables and reinforcing service logic.
